Hi Sam

First of all, sorry if my English is not very good.

OK, here I send to you some programs in REXX and ASM, that if you
think could be useful, I would like you to put them it in the CBT
tape

My name is Pergentino Arias, and my e-mail is
pergen@mixmail.com

I'm from Spain ( Europe ), and here I am for any questions you
have about the programs I send.

Thank you.
