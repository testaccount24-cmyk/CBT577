A load library, in TSO XMIT format, has been included in this pds
as member $LOADLIB.  To expand this into a real load library, execute
the TSO command:

     RECEIVE INDS(USERID.FILE577.PDS($LOADLIB))

and answer the prompt with DSN(   ) VOL(   ) if you wish to change
these aspects of the load library that will be produced.

These are assembled and linked versions of the assembler programs
from this pds.
