Note from Sam Golob:  I think the point here, is that MNF only
     works for sequential datasets, not for entire pds'es.  I
     had misunderstood that, and therefore I got an error when
     I tried to execute it against a pds.

I'm sorry. IRXNREG is the program I send, and than I see you just
compiled.  I see you put "CALL 'SBGOLOB.LOAD(IRXNREG)' " in the
REXX MNF I see you put the YREGS, ok, I forget it. I send to you
the jcl which i use to compile the program, for you to see the
parameters i'm using in the compilation. The arcchieve is on
ascii. I see the message IEC020I 001-4: If the return code is 4,
for QSAM, ABE or an incorrect value for EROPT parameter in the
DCB and/or no error handling (SYNAD) exit was specified. This
program works with sequential files ( or members of a librarie),
but not with libraries, or VSAM I assembled your version and
prove it in my installation and it works.
